#Order Portal

This is a project that I have been working on as a prototype supplier ordering system.

The project is far from complete however it is a solid proof of concept and will be used to determine whether or not to go ahead with further development.

A live demo of the project can be found at [example.canham.nz:9000](http://104.131.33.193:9000/).

To play around with the code yourself clone this repo and run the following commands:

```
cd Order_Portal
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

You will now have a live reloading version of the project that you can fiddle with.
